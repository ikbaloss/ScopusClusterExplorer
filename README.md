# ScopusClusterExplorer
By reading a CSV file from Scopus and its associated GML file generated by VOSviewer, this app can display the abstracts of the corresponding articles, book chapters, or books.
Since this is a HTML5/JavaScript app, you can directly use it by clicking https://ikbaloss.github.io/ScopusClusterExplorer/
